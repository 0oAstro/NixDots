[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

Fully fetured NixOS and Home Manager config with some bits borrowed from others. Using [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

You can check out all this flake has to offer with

## People

These are the people whom I've taken inspiration from while writing these
configs. There surely are more but I tend to forget. Regardless, I am thankful
to all of them.
